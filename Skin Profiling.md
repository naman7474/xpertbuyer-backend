. (AI from photos can estimate oiliness vs flakiness; user can self-report typical dryness or shine areas). This determines product formulations (e.g. lighter gels for oily skin, richer creams for dry skin).
Skin Tone and Fitzpatrick Phototype: (User/AI; essential) Record skin color and undertone (fair, medium, dusky, deep; warm/cool/neutral). Dermatologists use the Fitzpatrick scale (I–VI) to quantify tone and UV sensitivity

. (AI analysis of a selfie can approximate tone/phototype; user can select from a chart). Undertone is crucial for matching makeup foundations and sunscreen needs.
Primary Skin Concerns: (User; essential) List key issues (acne, hyperpigmentation, melasma, dark circles, redness, wrinkles, fine lines, dullness, dehydration, enlarged pores, sensitivity). In the Indian context, post-inflammatory pigmentation (PIH) and melasma are very common – over 70% of Indians under 35 with acne have brown spots left behind

. (AI can detect visible blemishes, scars, wrinkles, spots or rosacea from images; other concerns like itching or itching-prone eczema require user input).
Sensitivity & Allergies: (User; essential) Note any known skin sensitivities or allergies (e.g. fragrance, lanolin, parabens, nickel, etc.). Sensitive or reactive skin must avoid certain actives, so users should report intolerance. (AI cannot detect allergies.) Sensitive-skin types often need hypoallergenic products

. (AI can only infer tanning or sun damage from images, not habits.)
Hair Profiling
Hair Pattern/Texture: (User/AI; essential) Determine natural hair type: straight (Type I), wavy (Type II), curly (Type III) or coily/kinky (Type IV)

. Texture (fine/medium/coarse) also matters for product weight. (AI from an image of air-dried hair can roughly identify curl pattern and density; user can confirm texture by feel or known classification.) Indian hair varies widely, but most fall into wavy–curly categories.
Hair Thickness/Density: (User/AI; essential) Assess thickness (diameter) and density (thin vs thick overall volume). Dense, thick hair may need richer conditioners, while fine hair benefits from lightweight formulas. (Image analysis can give a rough idea of density and visible volume; user can self-assess by how easily scalp is seen.)
Scalp Condition: (User; essential) Note scalp type – oily, dry or normal. (User input essential; AI may infer from visible shine or flakiness on scalp in photos.) An oily scalp often accompanies dandruff; a dry scalp suggests flaky, itchy issues.
Hair Porosity: (User; optional) Porosity (low/normal/high) reflects cuticle condition – high porosity dries quickly and loses moisture, low resists moisture. (Determined by a simple float test by user; not from images.) This affects conditioning needs.
Hair Concerns: (User; essential) Check current issues: hair fall/loss (male/female pattern baldness, alopecia), thinning (diffuse), breakage/split ends, dryness, frizz, heat damage, chemical damage (bleaching/dye), scalp issues (dandruff: dry/oily flakes, itching). For example, chronic pollution in cities can make hair dry and brittle

. (AI can spot split ends and scalp flakiness in high-res photos; other concerns by questionnaire.)
Hair Treatments & Routine: (User; essential/optional) Record permanent or repeated treatments: dyes, relaxers, keratin treatments, frequent heat styling, tight hairstyles (braids/ponytails which can cause traction alopecia). Also note haircare routine: wash frequency, use of oils (coconut oil/mustard oil are common in India), conditioners, masks. (All user-input; AI cannot know routine or internal damage.)
Makeup Preferences
Foundation Shade & Undertone: (User; essential) Precise color match for foundation/concealer is crucial. Users should select shade according to their skin tone and undertone (warm/golden vs cool/pink). (AI face analysis can estimate tone, but final match needs user validation.)
Finish Preference: (User; optional) Matte, dewy (glowy), or satin finish preference for foundation and face products. (A personal aesthetic choice.)
Makeup Style/Frequency: (User; optional) Casual vs glam, daily light makeup vs occasional full face. This affects product strength and formula. (User input.)
Sensitivity & Allergies: (User; essential) Note any reactions to makeup ingredients (e.g. eyelash/glue allergies, nut-derived pigments, certain preservatives). Many makeup formulations (pigments, fragrances) can irritate sensitive skin or eyes. (User input mandatory; AI cannot detect this.)
Favorite Colors/Palettes: (User; optional) Preferred color families for lipsticks, eyeshadows (e.g. neutrals vs brights). Useful for personalized suggestions, though not strictly essential.
Lifestyle & Environment
Location/Climate: (User; essential) Geographic region and climate (urban/rural; Himalayan/coastal/plains; seasonal variations). For instance, dry winter air (low humidity) causes flaky skin
createdby.co
, while tropical humidity can mean excess oil and frizz. (User selects location; AI cannot infer.)
Pollution Exposure: (User; essential) Level of air pollution (e.g. city commuting, industrial area). High pollution generates free radicals, leading to accelerated aging, hyperpigmentation and skin sensitivity
timesofindia.indiatimes.com
 and can dull, dry hair. (AI can sometimes detect soot or dullness in images, but typically user reports environment.)
Sun/UV Exposure: (User; essential) Time spent outdoors during peak sun (especially relevant in India’s sunny climate). UV exposure is a major extrinsic aging factor
createdby.co
. (Helps determine SPF recommendations.)
Water Quality: (User; optional) Hard water (common in many Indian cities) can dry skin and hair. (Optional data; user note.)
Diet & Nutrition: (User; essential) Dietary patterns (vegetarian/vegan, high-spice, hydration level). Diets high in antioxidants and hydration support skin health, whereas excess grease/spice or dehydration can exacerbate acne and dull skin. (User questionnaire; AI cannot assess diet.)
Lifestyle Habits: (User; essential) Sleep quality/hours, stress level, smoking and alcohol use. Chronic stress and poor sleep worsen acne and aging; smoking accelerates wrinkles and hair thinning; alcohol dehydrates skin. (User input.)
Exercise/Activity: (User; optional) Frequency of exercise (regular sweating can clear pores but requires cleansing).
Occupational/Environmental Exposures: (User; optional) E.g. air-conditioned office work (drying), swimming (chlorine exposure), factory/chemical exposure.
Demographics
Age: (User; essential) Skin and hair needs vary by life stage (teen vs adult vs elderly). For example, 75% of young adults suffer acne
medicalnewstoday.com
, whereas older users prioritize anti-aging.
Gender/Identity: (User; essential) Male, female or other; different gender groups have different hormonal influences (e.g. androgens cause male-pattern baldness, menstrual hormones/PCOS affect women’s skin). Also guides product styling (e.g. skincare vs shaving products for men).
Ethnicity/Community: (User; optional) In India, sub-ethnic variations (skin undertone, hair texture) may be captured by region or community (North vs South Indian). This can subtly influence baseline pigmentation. (Optional input.)
Regional Subculture: (User; optional) Some regional practices (e.g. regular hair oiling, turmeric masks) could be noted if impacting routine.
Hormonal Status: (User; essential) Pregnancy, breastfeeding, menopause, or conditions like PCOS/thyroid. These profoundly affect skin/hair (e.g. melasma during pregnancy, hair thinning at menopause). (User questionnaire.)
Genetics/Family History: (User; optional) Family history of hair loss, melasma, eczema, etc. (Can help in risk assessment.)
Health & Medical Conditions
Skin Conditions: (User; essential) History of dermatological conditions: acne vulgaris, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, vitiligo, keratosis pilaris, etc. (Guides ingredient caution.)
Hair/Scalp Disorders: (User; essential) History of alopecia areata, seborrheic dermatitis, scalp infections. (User report.)
Allergies/Intolerances: (User; essential) Any systemic allergies (food/drug) or photosensitivity (e.g. lupus), which can affect skin reactions.
Medications: (User; essential) Current drugs (e.g. isotretinoin dries skin, steroids affect skin thickness, hormone therapy, chemotherapy causing hair loss).
Chronic Illness: (User; optional) Diabetes, autoimmune disease can slow healing; anemia or thyroid issues can worsen skin dryness and hair loss. (Optional input.)
Mental Health/Stress: (User; optional) High stress/anxiety can manifest in skin flares.
Image-Sharing & Privacy
Photo Analysis Consent: (User; essential to opt-in) Willingness to upload face and hair photos for AI analysis. If yes, AI can directly assess tone, texture, spot severity, and hair pattern. (Privacy note: Platform should assure users that images are processed securely, not stored or shared.) If no, all parameters must come from questionnaire. AI-based analysis can be leveraged where consent is given (enhancing accuracy of tone, pore size, wrinkle detection), but no sensitive health detail can be inferred without explicit consent
